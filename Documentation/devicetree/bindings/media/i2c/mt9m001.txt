* Aptina 1/2-Inch SXGA CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Aptina MT9M001 is a 1/2-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
an active array size of 1312H x 1048V. It is programmable through a simple
two-wire serial interface.

Required Properties:

- compatible: value should be either one among the following
	(a) "aptina,mt9m001" for MT9M001 color sensor
	(b) "aptina,mt9m001m" for MT9M001 monochrome sensor

Optional Properties:

- link-frequencies: List of allowed link frequencies in Hz. Each frequency is
	expressed as a 64-bit big-endian integer.

For further reading on port node refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	mt9m001@5d {
		compatible = "aptina,mt9m001";
		reg = <0x5d>;

		port {
			mt9v032_out: endpoint {
				link-frequencies = /bits/ 64
					<13000000 26600000 27000000>;
			};
		};
	};
